# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix
# Task: Rotate 2D Matrix

Given an n x n 2D matrix, the task is to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise in-place without returning anything. The matrix will always be 2-dimensional and non-empty. An example is provided where a 3x3 matrix is rotated, demonstrating the function `rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)` which transforms the matrix as expected.
