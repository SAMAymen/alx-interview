# 0x0A. Prime Game
## Task 0: Prime Game
Maria and Ben play a game where they take turns choosing a prime number from a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to n, removing that number and its multiples. The player unable to make a move loses. They play x rounds, with n varying each round. Maria always goes first, and both play optimally. The function `isWinner(x, nums)` determines the winner of the most rounds. If undetermined, it returns None. Example: For x = 3 and nums = [4, 5, 1], Ben wins the most rounds.
