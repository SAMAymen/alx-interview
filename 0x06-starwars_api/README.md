# 0x06. Star Wars API
## Task Summary

Create a script that prints all characters of a specified Star Wars movie using the Star Wars API. The script takes the Movie ID as the first positional argument and displays each character name per line in the order listed in the "characters" array from the /films/ endpoint. The script must utilize the `request` module. The relevant files are located in the `alx-interview` repository, within the `0x06-starwars_api` directory, specifically in the `0-starwars_characters.js` file. For more information, refer to [swapi-api.hbtn.io](https://swapi-api.hbtn.io/) and the [request module](https://github.com/request/request).
